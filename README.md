# companion-module-generic-visca-ptz
A [Bitfocus](https://github.com/bitfocus) Companion version 3.x.x module.

The purpose of this module is for managing generic Pan, Tilt, Zoom (PTZ) camera models that can be controlled using VISCA commands over IP. 
This module uses it's own presets module in order to function more effectively with camers with slow processors. Utilizing a modular presets function allows for backup of presets without having to physically move the head for each preset, and supports a virtually unlimited number of presets. 
This module specifically supports the Bolin VCC7-4K-20s.

## Install dependencies for development:

**Environment:**
Install NPM, Yarn, and Bitfocus Companion.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new folder named <code>companion-module-dev</code>.
2. Clone and unzip the branch into the <code>companion-module-dev</code> folder.
3. In a command prompt/terminal, navigate to the unzipped folder, type <code>yarn</code> to download dependency files.
4. Launch Companion and modify the Developer modules path to <code>companion-module-dev</code>.
5. The module appears in “Add Connection” search as “Aver” or "PTZ"

## Testing VISCA over IP with camera:

Use the open-source [PacketSender](https://packetsender.com/) software for testing VISCA commands directly with the camera. Refer to the AVER document for VISCA commands of models PTZ310/PTZ330, TR530/320, TR311HN, TR311, TR313, TR331, and TR333 [^1][^2]. Even if a specific model isn’t mentioned, the commands might still work.

**With PacketSender:**
1. Configure settings: 
```
Name: Camera 1 Preset 1
Address: Camera IP Address
HEX: 01 00 00 09 00 00 00 00 81 01 04 3F 02 01 FF
Port: 52381
Type: UDP
```
2. Click “Send” to load/recall preset 1 (presuming it’s saved on the camera).
